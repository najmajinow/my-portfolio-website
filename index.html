        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            
            
         Hi there! I'm a web developer who loves creating beautiful and easy-to-use websites. 
            I've always been fascinated by how websites work, and over time, I taught myself how to build them
             using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I specialize in making static websites that look great 
             and do exactly what my clients need them to do.</p>
            
           <p>I pay a lot of attention to detail and always aim to write clean and efficient code. 
            
            I'm also big on communication—I want to make sure that every project I work on perfectly matches 
            what the client has in mind.</p>
            
           <p> When I'm not working on websites, I enjoy reading self-improvement books, going to the gym, 
            and watching true crime documentaries. Im always looking to learn more and improve my skills.</p>
            
            Thanks for checking out my portfolio. Im excited about the possibility of working together to bring your website ideas to life!

            <p>

                The site is crafted to be modern and easy to navigate, effectively showcasing the company’s 
                services and completed projects. The primary objective was to establish a strong and

            <h2> Halal Haven</h2>
            <p>
                
                I had the opportunity to work on the website for Halal Haven, a halal restaurant, 
                where I was responsible for the entire web development process. This project allowed me 
                to apply my skills in creating a user-friendly and visually appealing online platform that
                 reflects the restaurant’s values and commitment to quality halal food.</p>
                
               <p> My Experience:
                - Design & Development: I enjoyed designing a welcoming and intuitive interface that customers can easily navigate. Working on the menu display was particularly rewarding, as I focused on making it simple for users to find and choose their favorite dishes.
                - Responsive Layout: Ensuring that the website was fully responsive across all devices was a key focus. I learned a lot about optimizing layouts for different screen sizes and making sure that the user experience remained consistent.
                - Enhanced Visuals: I created custom graphics and visuals to align with the restaurant's branding, which involved selecting and integrating images that conveyed the warmth and quality of the dining experience.
                - Problem-Solving: One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that all elements of the
                 website loaded quickly and performed well despite a large amount of content and images. 
                 I tackled this by optimizing image sizes and improving the site’s overall performance, which 
                 enhanced user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
