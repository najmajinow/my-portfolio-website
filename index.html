        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm a web developer who loves creating beautiful and easy-to-use websites. I've always been fascinated by how websites work, and over time, I taught myself how to build them using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I specialize in making static websites that look great and do exactly what my clients need them to do.</p>
        <p>I pay a lot of attention to detail and always aim to write clean and efficient code. I'm also big on communication—I want to make sure that every project I work on perfectly matches what the client has in mind.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working on websites, I enjoy reading self-improvement books, going to the gym, and watching true crime documentaries. I'm always looking to learn more and improve my skills.</p>
        <p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I'm excited about the possibility of working together to bring your website ideas to life!</p>
